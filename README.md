# 🏛 My personalized Agile framework for learning data analytics skills

## Planning My Learning Development

As I continued being fascinated with Data Analytics and the art of discovering insights from raw data, I knew I wanted to pursue a professional career within this domain.

To break into an analytical role, I researched the skills I would need to develop in order to be successful in generating positive value for my employer.

To ensure I have an incremental learning planning I adopted some of the agile practices (Scrum in particular) to help me develop a learning plan.

> Note: As a Certified Scrum Master, I have intentionally chosen not apply all components of Scrum, rather only some components that can allow me to help **plan my learning activities**, and help me **keep track of my progress** while I primarily focus on data skills development, rather than Scrum application.

### What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework that was originated by its creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland. It was designed to help people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

Through Scrum, a **Scrum Master** fosters an environment where:
1. A **Product Owner** orders the work for a complex problem in to a Product Backlog
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an increment of value during a Sprint
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. Repeat

For the context of learning, I am the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Developer working towards product (learning) increments.

### What is a Product Backlog?

A Product Backlog is an ordered, emergent list that is updated by the Product Owner that help improve the product. Product Backlog items completed during one sprint are ready to be used for value creation.

In the learning context, all the skill tasks that are removed from Product (learning) Backlog into a Sprint Backlog in the form of **user stories** are ready to be applied as soon as the Sprint duration is over.

### What is a User Story?

User Story is a Scrum tool where Product Backlog items are broken down into smallest unit of work that is actively updated within the Sprint Backlog.

In the learning context, learning activities are broken down into further tasks to effectively track and measure specific items that are of increment value to the Product Owner

### What is a Sprint?

Sprint is the oxygen of Scrum that enables immediate value creation.

Sprint is a time-boxed event (usually 2 weeks, but for my learning goal I kept each Sprint at a length of 1 week). A new Sprint starts as soon as one Sprint ends.

All the learning activities for the Sprint Goal are to be carried out within the duration of the Sprint.

### Creating and Refining a Product (learning) Backlog:

As a Product Owner I identified value in learning **SQL**, **Tableau** and **Python**.

For this example, I will be showing examples for the following Sprint Goal.

> Sprint Goal: Learn fundamental SQL queries to analyze relational data.

I began by identifying the valuable SQL learning activities in order of their priorities:
1. Extracting data from database/tables
2. Filtering Data based on requirements
3. Aggregating data for results
4. Grouping results
5. Getting results in preferred order
6. Complex SQL statements

The backlog was intentionally kept vague to demonstrate granulizing during refinement process. However, it can be defined into smaller tasks/user stories that can directly be moved into Sprint.

To define the activities the Sprint, I carried out the refinement of backlog to granulize the learning activities into User Stories.

Following is a breakdown of the SQL learning activities into forms of user stories:
1. Extracting Data (_From_)
2. Joining Tables (_Joins_)
3. Data Filtering (_Where_)
4. Aggregate Functions (_Sum, Min, Avg, Max_)
5. Grouping of Results (_Group By, Having_)
6. Loading Statements (_Order by, Limit_)
7. Common Table Expressions
8. Window Functions

### Sprint Backlog

The top 4 priority backlog items were added to the Sprint Backlog to develop and track the learning progress during Sprint of **1 week**:

As it can be seen in the above example, I tracked my learning progress and actively updated the status based on progress.

During this process I ensured to apply the following Scrum values:
- **Commitment**: Dedicate myself to stay disciplined to learn and actively update the sprint backlog everyday
- **Focus**: Made sure to remain focused on the goal and to remove impediments such as distractions hindering the Spring goal
- **Openness**: Being honest with myself regarding how much I have learned before moving the user stories to '_Done_'
- **Courage**: Being courageous to accept challenges and solve exercises to apply my knowledge on different datasets

### Sprint Review

On the last day of the Sprint (1 week duration), I decided to evaluate with honesty to evaluate if I had achieved the learning target, and if I was not satisfied with the outcomes, I moved them into incorporation of next Sprint to continue my learning development. Else, I had worked on refining and reprioritizing the Product (learning) Backlog to prepare for the next Sprint.

### Sprint Retrospective

After carrying out the Sprint Review and before beginning the next Sprint I reflected upon my learning activities and tried to identify if there were improvements that I could apply for the next Sprint. Some of the findings for improvement were:
- **Reduce cutting-corners/technical debt**: Making sure I learn properly, rather than learn to mark user stories as '_Done_'
- **Improving commitment to stick to goal**: On a couple of instances I found that I was getting ahead of myself and branching out my learning into different directions. E.g, While learning the WHERE statement I started looking at CTE and subqueries which was not part of my Sprint Goal. Curious Much?! 😬🙈

## Reach out to me

As I continue to apply the Scrum framework towards developing my data analytics skills, I would like to request your feedback on some of my projects within the repositories as I look to incorporate "stakeholder" feedback within my "product goal" which is my skillset, and to make the Scrum-based agile learning framework even more robust.

Lastly, if you are interested in applying these practices into your organization practices or personal learning goals, feel free to reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohaanzuberi/).
